            <p>
                <a href="http://netabomani.com">neta bomani</a> is an abolitionist, educator and zine maker who is
                interested in parsing information and histories while making things by hand with human and non-human
                computers.
            </p>


            <p> This website is an archived zine project from January 28 - May 7, 2021, where Neta made and <a
                    href="https://instagram.com/mchapoarchive">posted</a> a zine made on the same day, everyday for
                100 consecutive days as an extension of the 100 Days of Making class in the Interactive
                Telecommunications
                program at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. The 100 days ended in a final complicated zine called <a
                    href="https://netabomani.com/darkmatter" target="_blank">Dark Matter Objects</a> which doubled as
                Neta's graduate thesis.</p>
