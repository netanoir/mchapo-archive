            <p>
                <a href="http://netabomani.com">neta bomani</a> is a learner and educator who is interested in understanding the practice of reading and parsing information as a collaborative process between human and non-human computers. <br><br> Netaâ€™s work combines social practices, workshops, archives, oral histories, computation, printmaking, zines, and publishing, to create artifacts that engage abolitionist, black feminist, and do-it-yourself philosophies.
            </p>


            <p> This website is an archived zine project from January 28 - May 7, 2021, where Neta made and <a
                    href="https://instagram.com/mchapoarchive">posted</a> a zine created on the same day, everyday for
                100 consecutive days, as an extension of the 100 Days of Making class in the Interactive
                Telecommunications
                program at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. The 100 days ended in a complicated zine called <a
                    href="https://netabomani.com/darkmatter" target="_blank">Dark Matter Objects</a> which doubled as
                Neta's graduate thesis.</p>

                <p>Neta loves to make zines and will most likely add zines to this project in the future.</p>
